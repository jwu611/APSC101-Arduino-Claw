# APSC101 Arduino Claw
- Opens/closes claw depending on the sensor's distance above the floor
- Closes claw to pick up object when sensor is 15 cm or less above the floor
- Opens claw to drop off object when 30cm+ above the floor
- Resets to open position when sensor is 40cm+ above the floor
- A delay is included before opening/closing to allow leeway time for operator to get into final position
